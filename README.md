<ul>
  <li>I use djoser and simple jwt for auth by tokens</li>
  <li>For activation account by email i add custom user model and manager</li>
  <li>Add unit and integration tests with 92% coverage</li>
  <li>In "My Profile" you can choose avatar and crop-scale</li>
</ul>

i used postgresql and added it to docker so you can run this code on your own without any problem
